題目 a：  
If the output of an AND gate is passed through a NOT gate, the combination computes the Boolean operation called NAND, which has an output of 0 only when both its inputs are 1. The symbol for a NAND gate is the same as an AND gate except that it has a circle at its output. The following is a circuit containing a NAND gate. What Boolean operation does the circuit compute?

題目 b：  
If the output of an OR gate is passed through a NOT gate, the combination computes the Boolean operation called NOR that has an output of 1 only when both its inputs are 0. The symbol for a NOR gate is the same as an OR gate except that it has a circle at its output. The following is a circuit containing an AND gate and two NOR gates. What Boolean operation does the circuit compute?
